Please note:
<br>
This kernel marks the begin of 5.1 series and has been completely built 
from scratch after CM team changed the source code base completely.
<br>Please expect 
some broken things in very worst case.
<br>
<br>
CM13 is <u><b>still</b></u> not 100% stable, so please "happily" expect some crashes and 
reboots. This will get better step by step over the time as CM13 is currently under 
heavy development.

Side note:
Interactive CPU governor is by far the most stable governor on this device, so you might 
consider using it when your main goal is highest stability.
